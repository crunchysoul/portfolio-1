# My Portfolio Project (www.glenndimaliwat.com)
A portfolio website is something that will not only help me get a job, but it will also represent my brand and all my digital services. What I have in mind is a portfolio that I can update over time. It is a project that will never be finished.

For my design, I decided to go with cool and calm blue colours with a hint of grey and brown. For me, these colours are very flexible as they can be transformed from urban to corporate. Although for the theme that I chose, it will have to be suitable for the photo which I recently took in Melbourne.  I also went with a modern hipster logo to represent my brand and a wolf theme to express my values as a pack leader or a team member.

# Trello Board
I am using agile methodologies in building my project which is why I opened a public Trello board. This kept me organized all throughout the project and minimize the stress in remembering all the details and putting them into action.       

The trello board can be found at this [link](https://trello.com/b/pEZaMjod)     

# Mood Board
My Pinterest mood board is composed of photos from keywords "Winter", "Wolf", "Hipster", "Vikings" and "Beards". Mostly, what I got on this board are the Runic Typography and symbols for my logo and the Hazy Nature background idea for my hero image. My colour choice was already decided upon even before I completed my mood board and I am quite happy with it.

My Spotify playlist set most of the mood on my website. I believe it has created a very calm ambience and a good balance between content and theme. I appreciated this mood board more than the Pinterest because the music also kept me productive as I was designing my mockup in Figma.

# Inspiration
My tagline "Aim for the moon. Move fast, fail better and break stuff" is inspired by these popular quotes. For me, a tagline creates a first impression once someone visits your website.        

*“Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.”* ― Norman Vincent Peale

*"Move fast and break things"* — Mark Zuckerberg

*"Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try Again. Fail again. Fail better."* — Samuel Beckett

+ Denise Chandler
- Among all the websites that I visited, Denise's website really got my attention and it became my sole inspiration. Her choice of colour scheme is quite unique and it works really well with her theme. Like my design, she also incorporated a tagline "Stand Out" and a character in her theme which is a "sea monster". I believe this really represented her objective to stand out and it did as her website is among the top 15 developer portfolio website.

# Style Guide and Wireframes
For my mockup design, I used Figma while my colour scheme is extracted from [colormind.io](colormind.io). Designing my website from Figma was a wonderful experience as I could visually predict the outcome of my website without having to code anything.     

I however coded small parts as I went through my design because I needed to know my options in terms of CSS possibilities. This resulted in me having multiple versions of my designs. Each version is a milestone of certain decisions such as "Should I use flexbox to list down my skills?", "Should I create a separate section for my Instagram photos?", or "What would happen to this photo on a certain screen size breakpoint?".       

This strategy worked for me as every time I am in doubt, I would just create a new version of my design in Figma.

# Features
+ SCSS      
SCSS is a godsend feature me as not only was I more organized in sectioning my website, I was also able to use to Mixins for cross-browser CSS and Variables for Colors, Fonts and Shadows. I am really happy that I learned SCSS and used it on this project.      

+ JQuery        
JQuery is something that I wanted to avoid for this portfolio until I needed it for page animations. It, however, saved me a lot of time especially with my navigation bars.        

+ Google Analytics

+ Page Performance validation using Google PageSpeed Insights

+ Optimized images using [Optimizilla](http://www.optimizilla.com)

* Optimized CSS and JavaScript using [Minify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minifier)        
    ```npm install -g minify```     
    ```minify animation.js --output animation.min.js --no-comments```       
    ```minify navigation.js --output navigation.min.js --no-comments```
