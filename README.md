# My Portfoilio Project
A portfolio website is something that I have always wanted to do but was never motivated to create one until this Bootcamp project. Going into this project, I knew how important it is not only to get a job but also it represents my brand and services.

For my website, I initially wanted something minimalistic, but knowing that I have to put a lot of content, it will not fit in the overall design and may not represent my personality. In result, I decided to challenge myself more by having a kind of hipster but clean and fun design.
