# My Portfolio Project
A portfolio website is something that will not only help me get a job, but it will also represent my brand and all my digital services. What I have in mind is a portfolio that I can update over time. It is a project that will never be finished.

For my design, I decided to go with cool and calm blue colours with a hint of grey and brown. For me, these colours are very flexible as they can be transformed from urban to corporate. Although for the theme that I chose, it will have to be suitable for the photo which I recently took in Melbourne.  I also went with a modern hipster logo to represent my brand and a wolf theme to express my values as a pack leader or a team member.

# Trello Board
I am using agile methodologies in building my project which is why I opened a public Trello board. This kept me organized all throughout the project and minimize the stress in remembering all the details and putting them into action.

# Mood Board
My Pinterest mood board is composed of photos from keywords "Winter", "Wolf", "Hipster", "Vikings" and "Beards". Mostly, what I got on this board are the Runic Typography and symbols for my logo and the Hazy Nature background idea for my hero image. My colour choice was already decided upon even before I completed my mood board and I am quite happy with it.

My Spotify playlist set most of the mood on my website. I believe it has created a very calm ambience and a good balance between content and theme. I appreciated this mood board more than the Pinterest because the music also kept me productive as I was designing my mockup in Figma.

Denise Chandler
Among all the websites that I visited, Denise's website really got my attention. The choice of colour scheme is quite unique and it works with her theme. Like my design, she also incorporated a tagline "Stand Out" and a character in her theme which is a "sea monster". I believe this really represented her objective to stand out and it did as her website is among the top 15 developer portfolio website.
