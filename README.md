# My Portfoilio Project
A portfolio website is something that I have always wanted to do but was never motivated to create one until this Bootcamp project. Going into this project, I knew how important it is not only to get a job but also it represents my brand and services.

For my website, I initially wanted a minimalist design, but knowing that I have to put in a lot of content, I believe it may not end up with what I want to achieve. Something too minimalist may ruin the purpose of the portfolio as I need it to represent my brand and my personality. In result, I decided to challenge myself by having a hipster design with a cold mood and a little bit of cartoon that represented my inner spirit animal. However, like in a minimalist design, it has to remain clean and simple and it needs to accommodate my content.

Denise Chandler - I really like how she divided her portfolio into sections with a color scheme that is not too far away from what I want to achieve. She also represented herself as a "sea monster". I believe this represented her inner spirit animal, a personlity which wants to stand out despite her known imperfections. She depicted her inner monster in a very cool and positive way.
